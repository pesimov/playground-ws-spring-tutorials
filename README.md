# playground-ws-spring-tutorials
Recording progress on tutorials about Java Spring. 

I will use the Github profile to record progress at which tutorials on Java Spring I am using. Furthermore, I will save a copy of the tutorials via forking them for reference. 

The goal of working on the tutorials is: 1. Practice interfacing Java Spring services, 2. Look into Java Spring model, 3. Create several microservices as a practice. Overview of the process is: to read "Spring in Action" offline; to download and run tutorials from spring.io and tutorialspoint; to create small microservice projects as a practice.

Progress: 
Installation: IntelliJ Idea, Gradle, STS
